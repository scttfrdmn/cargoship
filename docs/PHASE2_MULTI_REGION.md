# Phase 2: Multi-Region Pipeline Distribution

## Overview

Phase 2 introduces comprehensive multi-region coordination for CargoShip, enabling global data distribution with intelligent region selection, automatic failover, and optimal data placement across AWS regions.

## Architecture

The multi-region system consists of five core components:

### 1. Multi-Region Coordinator (`coordinator.go`)
- **Purpose**: Central orchestration of multi-region operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Global transfer orchestration across AWS regions
  - Sophisticated failover logic with alternative region selection
  - Background services for health checking, metrics collection, and failover detection
  - Real-time performance monitoring and regional capacity management
  - Context-aware shutdown with graceful service termination

### 2. Region Selection Engine (`region_selector.go`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent region selection for optimal performance
- **Selection Strategies**:
  - **Round Robin**: Even distribution across healthy regions
  - **Weighted**: Distribution based on regional capacity/performance
  - **Latency-based**: Routes to lowest latency region
  - **Geographic**: Routes based on geographic proximity
  - **Priority-based**: Routes based on configured region priorities
- **Features**:
  - Support for preferred regions and multi-region redundant uploads
  - Region scoring and health assessment logic
  - Dynamic region availability tracking

### 3. Cross-Region Failover System (`failover.go`)
- **Purpose**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Capabilities**:
  - Automatic failure detection with configurable thresholds
  - Graceful degradation strategies
  - Health monitoring with customizable intervals
  - Recovery threshold management
  - Manual and automatic failover modes

### 4. Global Load Balancer (`load_balancer.go`)
- **Purpose**: Intelligent traffic distribution across regions
- **Features**:
  - Session affinity support for consistent routing
  - Real-time health status integration
  - Weighted distribution based on region capacity
  - Dynamic region status updates

### 5. Multi-Region S3 Transport (`s3_transporter.go`)
- **Purpose**: S3-specific multi-region transport implementation
- **Capabilities**:
  - Integration with existing CargoShip staging and adaptive transport systems
  - Support for single-region uploads with failover
  - Redundant uploads across multiple regions
  - Comprehensive configuration management with sensible defaults
  - Real-time upload coordination and result aggregation

## Type System (`types.go`)

Comprehensive type definitions supporting:
- **Region Management**: Status tracking, capacity monitoring, health checks
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple strategies with session management
- **Failover Configuration**: Detection, recovery, and timeout settings
- **Monitoring**: Metrics collection, alerting thresholds
- **Request/Response**: Upload requests, results, and metadata

## Configuration

### Default Multi-Region Configuration
```yaml
enabled: true
primary_region: "us-east-1"
regions:
  - name: "us-east-1"
    priority: 1
    weight: 50
    status: "healthy"
    capacity:
      max_concurrent_uploads: 10
      max_bandwidth_mbps: 1000
    health_check:
      enabled: true
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      failure_threshold: 3
      success_threshold: 2
  - name: "us-west-2"
    priority: 2
    weight: 30
    status: "healthy"
    capacity:
      max_concurrent_uploads: 8
      max_bandwidth_mbps: 800
load_balancing:
  strategy: "round_robin"
  sticky_sessions: false
failover:
  auto_failover: true
  strategy: "graceful"
  detection_interval: 15s
  failover_timeout: 30s
  retry_attempts: 2
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  metrics_interval: 60s
```

### S3-Specific Configuration
```yaml
cross_region_retries: 2
failover_delay: 5s
redundant_uploads: false
redundant_region_count: 2
sync_validation: true
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Staging System Integration
- Seamless integration with existing CargoShip staging system
- Leverages adaptive transfer capabilities
- Maintains compatibility with predictive chunk staging

### Adaptive Transport Integration
- Works with real-time network adaptation
- Utilizes bandwidth optimization
- Maintains transfer parameter adaptation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Region Upload
```go
// Create multi-region transporter
config := DefaultMultiRegionS3Config()
transporter, err := NewMultiRegionS3Transporter(ctx, config, logger)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Perform upload with automatic region selection
request := &MultiRegionUploadRequest{
    UploadRequest: &UploadRequest{
        FilePath: "/path/to/file",
        Size: 1024 * 1024 * 100, // 100MB
    },
    Archive: archive,
    TargetBucket: "my-bucket",
}

result, err := transporter.Upload(ctx, request)
```

### Redundant Multi-Region Upload
```go
// Enable redundant uploads
config.RedundantUploads = true
config.RedundantRegionCount = 3

request.RedundancyLevel = 3
request.AllowDegradedUpload = true

result, err := transporter.Upload(ctx, request)
// Result contains upload status for all regions
```

### Failover Configuration
```go
// Configure aggressive failover
config.Failover.Strategy = FailoverImmediate
config.Failover.DetectionInterval = 5 * time.Second
config.CrossRegionRetries = 5
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Region Selection Performance
- **Round Robin**: O(1) selection time
- **Weighted**: O(n) where n is number of regions
- **Latency-based**: O(n) with cached latency measurements
- **Geographic**: O(n) with geographic distance calculation

### Failover Performance
- **Detection Latency**: Configurable (default: 15 seconds)
- **Failover Time**: < 5 seconds for healthy alternative regions
- **Recovery Time**: Automatic with configurable thresholds

### Memory Usage
- **Base Overhead**: ~10MB for coordinator and components
- **Per-Region Overhead**: ~1MB for metrics and state tracking
- **Session Tracking**: ~100KB per active upload session

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Metrics
- Region health status and response times
- Upload success/failure rates per region
- Network latency and throughput measurements
- Failover frequency and recovery times

### Performance Metrics
- Average upload duration per region
- Throughput optimization effectiveness

- Cross-region data transfer costs

### Alerting Thresholds

- Low throughput warnings
- High utilization alerts (default: >80%)

## Future Enhancements
