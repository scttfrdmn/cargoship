# Inventory Schema (WIP)

We will try to keep the inventory as standardized as possible, with that said,
we are tracking schema changes inside of `pkg/static/schemas`. These files
represent the schema at a given time. This can be generated using a hidden
subcommand: `suitcasectl schema > pkg/static/schemas/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
