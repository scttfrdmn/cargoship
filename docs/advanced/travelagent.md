# Travel Agent

Travel Agent is a remote API that `suitcasectl` will reach out to for reporting
and instructions. For example, it can be used to:

* Show a user the progress in a WebUI.
* Store the inventory in spot that can be later searched.
* Provide credentials and target information for a copy out to the cloud.

The Duke University implementation uses RToolkits as the Travel Agent endpoint,
however you can write your own as long as it supports the defined endoints.
