# Autocomplete for the CLI

If you are using either our homebrew or deb/rpm packages, command line
completion is enabled by default. If you aren't using one of these packages, you
can enable completion using `suitcasectl completion ...`. See `suitcasectl
completion $YOUR_SHELL -h` for help on your specific shell
