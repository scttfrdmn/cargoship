| pkg/aws/costs | Enhanced | 85.2% | Major | ✅ |
| pkg/gpg | Enhanced | 83.2% | Major | ✅ |
| Overall Project | 75.2% | 85.7% | +10.5% | ✅ |

### 2. Flaky Test Resolution ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Issue**: Pre-commit hooks failing due to non-deterministic test behavior
- **Resolution**: Fixed race conditions and probabilistic failures
- **Commit**: `38e6a88` - Fix flaky tests in cmd package for reliable pre-commit hooks

#### Technical Fixes
1. **TestUploadMetaConcurrentUploads**
   - Problem: Race condition in MockTravelAgent
   - Solution: Added mutex for thread-safe operations
   - Result: 100% consistent test passes

2. **TestGenerateTestData (random)**
   - Problem: 1/256 probabilistic failure
   - Solution: Statistical sampling across multiple bytes
   - Result: Negligible failure probability (~10^-22)

### 3. Documentation and Analysis ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **COVERAGE_COMPLETION.md**: Comprehensive coverage achievement report
- **FLAKY_TEST_RESOLUTION.md**: Detailed technical analysis of test fixes
- **Commit**: `b932062` - Document flaky test resolution and pre-commit hook fixes
